## Experimental data

Synthetic data can be generated using GenerateData.java without the need for a full local vantage6 (or even spring boot)
setup.

Included are samples of the Asia, Iris & Alarm datasets to uses as the basis.

The Xbif.xml files are adaptations of the bif files for use in weka as it does not accept regular .bif files.
